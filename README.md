# Indoor-Vehicle-Localization
This project focuses on indoor vehicle localization using LIDAR sensors, ROS, and Jetson Nano. The system utilizes Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and sensor fusion techniques to track a vehicleâ€™s position within an indoor environment.
# ðŸš— Indoor Vehicle Localization using LIDAR & ROS  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on **indoor vehicle localization** using **LIDAR sensors** and **ROS**. The goal is to accurately track a vehicle's position within an indoor environment using **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** and **sensor fusion techniques**.
